# constraintsatisfaction

Please enjoy my code!!

All that needs to be changed lie in the driver classes and the ConstraintSatisfactionProblem class.

In the latter, you can tinker with boolean values for MRV, LCV, and MAC3.

In the former, you can scroll to the main methods and change/add whatever you please. Hopefully, the pattern for how things should be instantiated to get the program to work is quite clear. (I.e. creating rectangles and adding them to the list of rectangles). Also, the report has more helpful tips on the code.
